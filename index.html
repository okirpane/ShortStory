It&rsquo;s head was that of a dog, just three times larger. It&rsquo;s body resembled Wanda&rsquo;s own, except for the hideous fur that grew in wet clumps randomly over her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gross.&rdquo; Wanda remarked harshly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The thing whimpered at her cold tone. Maybe, it was the thunder and rain outside. Wanda couldn&rsquo;t tell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rude, Wanda!&rdquo; her mom admonished in a whisper as she brought a bowl of soup from the kitchen and placed it gently in front of the creature. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drink this. You&rsquo;ll feel better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her mom sat next to it and wrapped her hands around it in a comforting embrace. Wanda gaped at the affection her mother was showering on the creature. No, she was more surprised by the total lack of disgust her parents showed. Did they not see what she was seeing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did they not see its drooling, ravenous maw? Or it&rsquo;s dirty matted fur?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did they not see the beast invading their warm, safe living room and their perfectly happy family?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wanda sat on the simple warm rug right by the fireplace, still not completely coming to terms with the reality she was in. This repulsive alien was being coddled by both her parents, who didn&rsquo;t seem to recognise the utter bizarreness and inhumanity of it. They just accepted this creature, that had showed up at their doorstep. Feeding it food, keeping it warm and comforting it as best as they could. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her parents ignored her confounded looks and eventually took the creature upstairs leaving Wanda alone, crackling with anger and drifting to sleep by the fireplace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning the creature had a name. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Her name is Regina.&rdquo; Her dad said at the breakfast table, &ldquo; We are&hellip; taking her in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be nice to her, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wanda did not reply. instead, she wolfed down her breakfast and hurried to school. She couldn&rsquo;t wait to tell her friends about the bizarre creature in her house. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When she regaled her absurd story, she was met with awe and intrigue. Everyone gathered around during the lunch break to hear more. She was the center of attention. Everytime she told the story to a new curious classmate, it changed, and Regina became more and more grotesque. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wanda went back home with a euphoric smile on her face. She reluctantly tore herself away from the loving audience that had followed her from lunch break, to art class, to drama rehearsal, to the school bus, and skipped back home up to her front door. Her mom opened the door, greeted her and quickly disappeared back into the house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How was school today?&rdquo; Wanda&rsquo;s mom asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was great!&rdquo; Wanda said with a smile on her face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She took off her shoes and socks leaving them both strewn near the door which she left clumsily half open. Wanda bounced into the kitchen of their house, which was small but neatly stocked with snacks, produce and a certain comfortable warmth. She grabbed a cookie and carried it out into the living room clenched between her teeth. She dropped it when she gaped at the scene before her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her dad was sitting with the thing at their rickety old piano, teaching it how to play a simple tune. Her mom was stirring her tea and humming along whenever it played something resembling a melody. It looked comfortable in the house, playing along and lapping up the attention it was getting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Her mom asked jovially, distracted by the creatures stumbling performance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of Wanda&rsquo;s joy was flushed out and replaced with disgust. She didn&rsquo;t want to see this inhuman creature happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my Piano!&rdquo; Wanda cried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know! Isn&rsquo;t she playing so well?&rdquo; Her dad responded with laughter and an encouraging pat on Regina&rsquo;s back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t use it. It&rsquo;s mine. I need it!&rdquo; Wanda tried to control her tone, but she could feel rage creeping into her voice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Honey, sit down. You must&rsquo;ve had a stressful day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My day was fine. I want my piano back, I need it for&hellip; practice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can practice later, right?&rdquo; Her dad said chuckling at another one of Regina&rsquo;s fumbles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No! I need it right now!&rdquo; Wanda shouted, &ldquo;What does it need the piano for anyway?&rdquo; Her parents&rsquo; grins faded and her father rose to walk up to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; He said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I said what does a&hellip; thing like that need the piano for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her dad glowered down at her, but she stood strong. Just because her parents were clearly delusional didn&rsquo;t mean she had to stoop to their level. She wasn&rsquo;t stupid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Apologize.&rdquo; He said curtly, &ldquo;Apologize right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re sorry, and that you&rsquo;ll never say something like that again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Say sorry.&rdquo; Her dad shouted, &ldquo; NOW!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I WON&rsquo;T.&rdquo; Wanda screamed, &ldquo;YOU BOTH ARE CLEARLY&hellip; STUPID!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wanda stormed off. As she marched upstairs to her bedroom she could hear whimpers from the creature, distracting her parents. They both forgot about her, turning their attention towards the plight of their new child. Leaving Wanda, once again, alone, sobbing and screaming with anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few mornings later the creature was coming to school with her. Wearing her old shirt and jeans. Slurping milk out of a kiddie bowl at the table, almost oblivious to the strife she was causing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Treat her well.&rdquo; Her dad said, &ldquo;Introduce her to your friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t let anyone bully her.&rdquo; Her mom added</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t bully her either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wanda didn&#39;t reply. She just got up, put her bowl in the sink and grabbed her bag. As Wanda stormed out the door her mom called after her, admonishing her rudeness but faltered for some reason. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember her&hellip;&rdquo; Her mom tried to say something, but Wanda was already out the door. There was time till the bus showed, so she decided to walk to school to get away from home as quickly as possible. When she reached, classes were about to start, and her peers had already been introduced to Regina.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her?&rdquo; Wanda&rsquo;s best friend Linda asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">it</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo; Wanda corrected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Linda craned her neck to look closer at the thing sitting in the front row. &ldquo;She looks normal. I thought you said she was a monster!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Of course she&rsquo;s a monster! You think a human-dog thing is normal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Linda stared at Linda now. As if </span><span class="c5">she </span><span class="c0">was the weird one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She could not believe that the infection of delusion had spread to her school as well. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were glazed and wide when they met Regina. They all loved her and over the next months and semesters, their love increased. Wanda was outshone and outmatched in everything. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everytime Regina topped another class test she had to watch her class applaud it and suck up to it for notes and tutoring. She had to watch Regina topple her as the queen of drama club, serenading everyone with her inhumanely perfect voice. She had to watch her parents slowly forget her name. She felt the pride drain out of their eyes when she walked into the room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything was about Regina and there was nothing Wanda could do about it. She could feel Regina laughing at her behind her back. It had to be behind her back because in front of her, Regina only had the guts to be the most artificially sweet thing in the world. Wanda knew what it was, but no one else did. That&rsquo;s why everyone thought she was completely unhinged from reality. Her parents sent her to a doctor to see if anything was wrong, &nbsp;But Wanda refused to talk to anyone anymore much less some quack doctor. She decided to block everyone out. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked at her feet when she spoke, and refused to register anyone&rsquo;s face when she walked through the corridors at school. Everyone was sick of her raving about dogs and monsters, and she was sick of everyone calling her mad. Wanda had become an outcast, both by choice and by her peers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why she was surprised to see one of her friends Linda knocking at her door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; She said to Linda as she opened the door for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; Linda said awkwardly. She hadn&rsquo;t really talked with Wanda in months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m...I&rsquo;m actually here to hangout with...Regina? Is she home?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wanda was surprised. &ldquo;Yeah, it-she&rsquo;s in her room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t like her?&rdquo; Linda asks with a smile. Wanda doesn&rsquo;t reply. She just let&rsquo;s Linda in and shuts the door. Wanda politely takes Linda&rsquo;s coat and hangs it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a girl you know. She&rsquo;s nice. Just give her a chance-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can hangout with us if you want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have work to do. You guys have fun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Linda sighed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re m-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Mad. I know.&rdquo; Wanda gives her a wry smile and walks up to her room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">She missed Linda. She missed her badly. Should she go back and give Linda a hug? Apologize for ending their friendship and beg of her to take her back, to laugh and play with her again? Take a step towards rebuilding their friendship and lifting herself from the misery of isolation? Wanda got hopeful. But then, she realised. That would mean interacting with Regina</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">again. That would mean treating that monster like a human. She would have to look at the slobbering mutt who had uprooted her life, point at it, and call it a friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, she went to it&rsquo;s room and knocked on the door. Regina swung it open and looked surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip; why&rsquo;re you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; Can I&hellip; I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo; Wanda stuttered, &ldquo;I wanted to apologize to Linda. And, maybe&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mom and dad aren&rsquo;t at home. You don&rsquo;t need to be nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not trying to be nice. I&hellip; Just want to hangout.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was it. She walked into the room, sat down and gradually joined in with their laughter and fun. They talked and talked till the afternoon oranges became black and the stars came out to greet humanity. Their conversation was easy and varied, leaving Wanda wanting for more as they chatted at the doorstep when Linda had to leave. When they finally closed the door behind her Regina and Wanda both sat in the living room, which had regained it&rsquo;s comforting warmth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Wanda said to Regina. Her feet hanging from the arm of the plushy red sofa.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; Regina said, as it lounged down on the soft carpet, &ldquo;Never knew you could be nice once in a while.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No problem. &rdquo; She paused, &ldquo;I need something to eat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wanda got up to go to the kitchen. She loved today and she was grateful. She felt happy, and included for once in a very long time. More importantly it helped her come to a decision she was debating internally for a long time. Regina was a sweetheart, and had almost immediately accepted her. They had an easy rhythm between them. Despite the hate, when they spoke as friends there was no tension. Wanda was grateful that she took the chance to meet it with an open mind with one of her bestfriends. If this didn&rsquo;t quell her hate for the creature nothing would. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So she walked out of the kitchen with a steel heart and mind. It looked up at her and smiled before morphing into an expression of confusion. Wanda took the sharpest knife she could find in the kitchen and gripped it tightly in her hands. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You still disgust me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wanda bounded forward and pinned the creature down, raising the knife over her head. Her mind was calm and without doubt. She knew that despite the creatures clever act. Despite it&rsquo;s pitch inerrant act as a perfect school girl and daughter. Despite it&rsquo;s humanity, this thing would only ever be a creature. Something that had taken her normal life from her and had replaced it with misery. This mutt was a threat, she had no doubt. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except, Just as she brought down the knife, it&rsquo;s form flickered. Just for a moment it was human. Alas, her knife was already buried and blood was already flowing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
